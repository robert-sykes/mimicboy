# MimicBoy - GameBoy Emulator

**MimicBoy** is a modern and efficient GameBoy emulator written in C++23. Its goal is to provide an authentic and
high-performance emulation experience while maintaining clean, maintainable code. The project is in very early
development, and many features are still a work in progress.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
